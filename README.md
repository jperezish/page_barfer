# Page Barfer

**Gross!** _Indeed._

Do you have a ton of text files you want to generate? Awesome. Use page barfer to barf out all that stuff.

>As a person who has a product catalog, I want to generate markdown partials with front matter for each one so I can use Jekyll to build out a static site.

Just modify Jekyll and do it there! Well you could couple this to Jekyll but that's not as fun as having a separate gem! Woot woot!
