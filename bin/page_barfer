      The 'barf' command reads the '_page_barfer.yml' config file.
      It gets the page layouts, the name of the product file and the catalog name.
      It then creates a directory for the catalog name,
      creates sub-directories for each product based on the product's hierarchy,
      creates a product detail page for each product that points to each product's
      layout.
